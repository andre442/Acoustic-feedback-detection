# Acoustic-feedback-detection
This code is the implementation of an algorithm to detect feedback in an audio signal using MATLAB.
By analyzing the frequency spectrum of the signal, a computational processing will be done in order 
to discover any undesirable harmonic feedback present in the spectral content.
